## Algorithms

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. Algorithms take inputs, process them through a series of well-defined steps, and produce outputs.

## Data Structures

Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, processing, and storing data. They enable efficient access and modification of data. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

## Characteristics of good code :

Good code can be described by two characteristics:

- **Readable**
- **Scalable:**
  - **_Time Complexity_** : Which means that as the input size increases, the code should not slow down significantly.
  - **_Space Complexity_**: Refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to execute in relation to the input size.
